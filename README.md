# Credit Card Fraud Detection

## Introduction
This project was completed as part of my **Data Science (CSE437)** course. It aims to detect fraudulent credit card transactions by implementing existing machine learning models.

## Dataset Description
The dataset contains online payment-related transactional data, accessible via Kaggle. It includes:

- **Rows**: 129,667 transactions, each representing a unique transaction.
- **Columns**: Details about the client, transaction amount, payment method, and whether the transaction was fraudulent.
- **Privacy**: All data is anonymized to ensure privacy and security.

### Source
- **Kaggle**: [Fraud Detection Dataset by Kartik Ahuja (2020)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kartik2112/fraud-detection).

## Project Overview
This project involved implementing and evaluating machine learning models for fraud detection, focusing on:

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and transforming raw data.
- **Feature Engineering**: Extracting meaningful insights from transaction details.
- **Model Selection & Training**: Implementing and comparing multiple machine learning algorithms.
- **Evaluation**: Assessing model performance using appropriate metrics.

## Technologies Used
- Python (NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Machine Learning Algorithms (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, etc.)

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/credit-card-fraud-detection.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook to train and evaluate models.

## Results & Findings
- Models were evaluated based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Imbalanced data handling techniques (e.g., SMOTE) were applied to improve fraud detection.
- The best-performing model achieved an accuracy of **X%** (update with actual result).

## Future Improvements
- Experimenting with deep learning approaches.
- Enhancing feature engineering techniques.
- Deploying the model as an API for real-time fraud detection.
